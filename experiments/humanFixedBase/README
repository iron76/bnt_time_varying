# Experiments related to the human dynamics estimation project
This repo presents the results on Maximum A Posteriori estimation of the dynamics of human subjects performing a simple Bowing task. From the physical characteristics of the subject, a simple 3 link, 2 DoF URDF is built and utilised for the computations. The subjects are equipped with a IMU placed on their chest and their movements and contact forces with the ground are captured using a VICON motion capture system. The data from the VICON is assumed to be preprocessed into the format of a matlab .mat file using appropriate libraries (see https://github.com/claudia-lat/VICON-C3D-Analysis for the compatible C3D based analysis of Vicon data).


## Requirements : 
1. Matlab 2012 or above (not tested on lower version).
2. You need to have properly installed BNT_time_varying (refer to https://github.com/iron76/bnt_time_varying)

## Data characteristics
The data required for the analysis must be independently downloaded into a subfolder called data. 

## Execution
The execution sequence is as follows : 
1. synchroniseIMU_VICON
2. computeLinkSensorFrames
3. organiseSensorData
4. main.m

If step 1 above is executed, main will take care of step 2 if it is not already existing. Note that any changes to sensorFrameExtraction or imuVICON_synchornise necessiates that you follow this execution sequence again.

## Analysis of results
The analysis can be carried out using the
