0. Download and unzip where preferred the 
dependencies (a) BNT toolbox and (b) FEATHERSTONE toolbox:
(0.a) https://bnt.googlecode.com/files/FullBNT-1.0.7.zip
(0.b) http://royfeatherstone.org/spatial/v2/spatial_v2.zip

1. Edit the file install.sh.template by inserting the proper values for the 
variables BTN_FOLDER and the SPATIAL_FOLDER folder where you unzipped
the toolboxes downloaded at step 0.
(1.a) BNT_FOLDER : 'put here the folder containing the BNT distribution'
(1.b) SPATIAL_FOLDER='put here the folder containing the SPATIAL_V2 distribution'

2. execute on terminal 'mv install.sh.template install.sh'

3. execute on terminal 'chmod +x install.sh'

4. execute on terminal './install.sh' saying [yes] to all overwriting

TO TEST THE SPARSE INVERSE DYNAMICS COMPUTATIONS

1. Open Matlab

2. Add the BNT and FEATHERSTONE toolboxes to the Matlab path

3. Try to test the installation running exmples/2014-12-featherstoneMeas/main.m

TO TEST THE KALMAN FILTERS ROUTINES

1. Download the dataset provided here:
https://db.codyco.eu/uploads/5481c384912095330a03f869.zip
and unzip it in the folder where bnt_time_varying is located

2. Open Matlab and add both downloaded toolboxes to the 
Matlab search path. 

3. Add the src/utils folder to the Matlab path
